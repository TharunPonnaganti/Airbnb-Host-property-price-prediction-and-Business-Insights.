# Airbnb-Host-property-price-prediction-and-Business-Insights.
This project analyzes Airbnb listings in the city of  New York to better understand how different attributes such as bedrooms, location, house type amongst others can be used to accurately predict the price of listing that is optimal in terms of the hostâ€™s profitability yet affordable to their guests.   *This model is intended to be helpful to the internal pricing tools that Airbnb provides to its hosts.*
